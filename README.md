This is a small simple extensible wrapper around the [IpInfo] (https://ipinfo.io/)  which enables you to get the user's location. The sole purpose of this wrapper
is to eliminate the pain staking process involved to get the your current location using the ipInfo Java libary. And the best part is you do not need an api key to use.
to use it :-).

## Example usage
```
<pre class="code"><code class="java">
 *     public class Main {
 *     public static void main(String[] args){
 *      NetworkImpl network=NetworkImpl.getInstance();
 *      network.setLogLevel(LogLevel.BODY);
 *      // you can use {@link Optional}.ifPresentOrElse() to handle instances when the response model is null
 *      network.makeRequest().ifPresent(responseModel -> {
 *          System.out.println(responseModel.getCity());
 *          System.out.println(responseModel.getCountry());
 *          System.out.println(responseModel.getHostname());
 *          System.out.println(responseModel.getIp());
 *          System.out.println(responseModel.getRegion());
 *      });
 *     }
 *     </code></pre>
